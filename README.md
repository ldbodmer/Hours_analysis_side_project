# Hours_analysis_side_project

This was a quick side project based on to answer questions posed by the sale's team:
Questions from Susanna to be addressed in the analysis:
- Exclude RAE (division) and SN (client).
- Exclude 2024 data, as many searches may not have billed yet.

Main analysis focus:
- For searches with 'K dates' in 2022 and 2023 (not 'create dates'), analyze the hours billed in 2024 (year-to-date).
- Provide the following insights:
   1. Total number of contracts created each year (2022 and 2023).
   2. Total number of contracts created each year that either:
      - Never billed, or
      - Billed fewer than 10 hours in total.
   3. Total number of contracts that:
      - Billed more than 10 hours, but
      - Did not bill any of those 10 hours within the first three months.

Next steps will involve filtering the dataset for relevant date ranges and conditions to answer these questions.
